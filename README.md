**6-Way-Smart-Traffic-Light-Controller**

Increase in population has lead to hefty increase in the number of vehicles on roads which in return lead to traffic jams, accidents and problems for traffic police and the citizens who are on foot on roads. In this project we have tried to design a new kind of traffic lights which could be used for 6 way roads which sounds quite weird but we will be needing such roads in future to divert the traffic and these traffic lights are smart as well as they will work on the base of density of jam on a particular road. This system will be a microprocessor based system and this microprocessor will control the traffic light by circuit using the sensors which will be determining the jam level on the roads. This how this system will work with the help of the sensors jam level displayer tool is another feature added to a system controlled by the microcontroller which is a traffic sign informs the drivers about the level of jam before reaching the road.
